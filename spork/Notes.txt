Commands/ptrs for aws ec2
 - console https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-2#Instances:v=3;$case=tags:true%5C,client:false;$regex=tags:false%5C,client:false;sort=desc:instanceState
 - get instance ips:
   aws ec2 describe-instances | grep -i publicipadd | cut -d\" -f4
 - stop instances
    aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids `aws ec2 describe-instances | grep -i instanceid | cut -d\" -f4`
 - log in 
    ssh -i hazsoup.pem ec2-user@ec2-3-144-108-49.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com

 - when creating the cluster you need to specify a pre-build keypair (hazsoup)

Blockers:
  - instances have python3.9, but not pip or pip3
  - looks like I will need to install each of those using 'yum'
  - I was able to ssh into an Amazon linux cluster, but not a

in gpig
 - views (=rdds) have 'checkpoints' and 'checkpoint plans'
 - views produce a storagePlan which is executed to produce the relation
 - a plan 
    - is compiled to a script that can be executed by the shell
      - compilers treat multi-input commands separately
    - is steps that are grouped into AbstractMapReduceTask
    - an AbstractMapReduceTask
       - has distribute steps, 0/1 map step, and 0/1 reduce step
         - distribute steps are special 'hadoop fs -getmerge SRC DST'

the main
 - allows you to call it with args '-do METHOD.ARG -view v' which means
   to perform some part of the preprocessing for a view
   - doStoreKeyedRows for map/reduce
   - doStoreRows
   - doDistinctMap
   - rowGenerator methods all read from stdin

micro spork:
 - adds machinery to produce plan and execute it

New idea: have separate map-reduce method using fire

    workers: list

       """Yields stuff."""
   def reduce(key:any, value:Iterator)
       """Returns one thing."""
